Due to our [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) app not being extended, our site is currently not being hosted on a domain.
If you would like to check out BeGroovy, you may self host it by doing these steps:

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/LOTaher/BeGroovy.git` in a new environment.

- Run `npm install` once inside the directory.

- Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
  - Find your `Project URL` and `Project API Key` by going to **Settings** -> **API**. Add both of them to your `.env` file in the project's main directory. 
  - Under **Database**, create a new table called `Posts`. In this table copy, [each of these columns](https://imgur.com/a/zs9h639).

- Create a [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/) account, then create a new app. This can be called whatever you'd like. 
  - Under your project's settings, add both the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` to the `.env` file.
  
Once completed run `npm run dev` in the main directory and enjoy!
